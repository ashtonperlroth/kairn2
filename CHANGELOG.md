## [1.9.0] — 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Autonomy level selection** — `kairn describe` prompts for autonomy level (1-4) during setup; `--quick` defaults to Level 1
- **Level 1 (Guided):** `/project:tour` command (interactive environment walkthrough), SessionStart welcome hook, `QUICKSTART.md` doc, workflow reference in CLAUDE.md
- **Level 2 (Assisted):** `/project:loop` command (workflow-specific automated cycle with approval gates), `@pm` agent (plans, specs, prioritizes — does not code)
- **Level 3 (Autonomous):** `/project:auto` command (PM-driven loop with worktree isolation and PR delivery)
- **Level 4 (Full Auto):** `/project:autopilot` command (continuous execution with stop conditions: max 5 features, test failure, Escape)
- **`src/autonomy.ts` module** — deterministic generation of level-specific commands, agents, hooks, and docs
- **Compiler prompt updated** — LLM tailors CLAUDE.md workflow sections based on autonomy level

### Changed
- **`EnvironmentSpec` type** — added `autonomy_level` field (1-4, defaults to 1)
- **Adapter** — applies autonomy-level content before writing files

---

## [1.8.0] — 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Interactive API key collection** — after `kairn describe` or `kairn optimize` writes environment files, prompts for each required API key with masked input; entered keys saved to `.env`, skipped keys get empty placeholders
- **`.env` file generation** — writes project-scoped `.env` with entered keys and empty placeholders for skipped keys
- **`.gitignore` auto-update** — automatically appends `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits
- **SessionStart hook** — generated `settings.json` includes a hook that loads `.env` into `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` so MCP servers can access API keys
- **`kairn keys` command** — add or update API keys for existing environments; detects required vars from `.mcp.json`, prompts for missing keys
- **`kairn keys --show`** — display which keys are set (masked) vs missing, with signup URLs
- **`--quick` flag** skips key prompts in `describe`, writes `.env` with empty placeholders instead

### Added (internal)
- **`src/secrets.ts` module** — shared utilities for key collection, `.env` reading/writing, `.gitignore` management, and env var detection from `.mcp.json`

---

## [1.7.0] — 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Verification section** in CLAUDE.md template — concrete verify commands (build, test, lint, type check) per project type; research projects get source-citation verification
- **Known Gotchas section** in CLAUDE.md template — living memory that grows with corrections, auto-prune guidance at 10 items
- **`/project:spec` command** — interview-based spec creation (5-8 questions → structured spec in docs/SPRINT.md)
- **`/project:prove` command** — verification on demand (run tests, diff vs main, rate confidence HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- **`/project:grill` command** — adversarial code review (challenges each change, rates BLOCKER/SHOULD-FIX/NITPICK)
- **`/project:reset` command** — clean restart preserving learnings (stash + reimplementation)
- **Statusline config** — auto-generated `statusLine` in settings.json for code projects (git branch + open task count)
- **Debugging guidance** in CLAUDE.md — "paste raw errors, use subagents for deep investigation"
- **Git workflow guidance** in CLAUDE.md — small commits, conventional format, <200 lines per PR

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md context budget** increased from 100 to 120 lines to accommodate new sections
- **Seed templates updated** — all 4 templates include new sections; code templates include new commands + statusline

---

## [1.6.0] — 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Interactive clarification flow** — LLM generates 3-5 clarifying questions with suggested defaults before compilation, eliminating hallucinated project details
- **`--quick` / `-q` flag** — Skip clarification questions for fast compilation (old behavior)
- **Branded CLI output** — Maroon/warm stone color palette with block-character KAIRN wordmark logo
- **`src/ui.ts` styling module** — Centralized `ui.*` functions for headers, sections, key-value pairs, tool display, env var setup, and error boxes
- **`src/logo.ts`** — Full banner (wordmark + braille cairn art) and compact banner for all commands
- **Ora spinner** — Animated progress spinner during compilation and scanning (replaces line-overwrite hack)
- **Branded error display** — Error boxes with styled headers for all failure modes
- **`--no-color` flag** — Global flag to disable colored output for piping/CI (also respects `NO_COLOR` env var)

### Changed
- **All 9 commands redesigned** — Consistent visual design with branded banners, section headers, key-value pairs, and styled status indicators across init, describe, optimize, list, activate, doctor, registry, templates, and update-registry

---

## [1.5.0] — 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Template gallery** — 4 curated pre-built environments (Next.js Full-Stack, API Service, Research, Content Writing) installed automatically on `kairn init`
- **`kairn templates`** — Browse and filter available templates with `--category` and `--json` options
- **`kairn activate` template fallback** — Activate templates by ID when not found in saved environments
- **`kairn registry list`** — Browse all tools (bundled + user-defined) with `--category` and `--user-only` filtering
- **`kairn registry add`** — Interactively add custom tool definitions to the user registry with validation
- **User registry** — Custom tools stored in `~/.kairn/user-registry.json`, merged with bundled registry (user tools take precedence by ID)
- **Hermes runtime adapter** — `--runtime hermes` flag on `describe` and `optimize` generates `~/.hermes/config.yaml` and `~/.hermes/skills/` from any EnvironmentSpec
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — Guide for community tool submissions via PR

### Changed
- **Registry loader refactored** — Deduplicated `loadRegistry()` from 3 files into shared `src/registry/loader.ts`
- **Templates directory** — `~/.kairn/templates/` created automatically alongside envs directory

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Sprint contract pattern** — `/project:sprint` command for defining acceptance criteria before coding, writes to `docs/SPRINT.md`
- **Multi-agent QA pipeline** — `@qa-orchestrator` (sonnet), `@linter` (haiku), `@e2e-tester` (sonnet, Playwright) agent templates in generated environments
- **PostCompact hook** — Auto re-reads CLAUDE.md and SPRINT.md after context compaction to restore project context
- **Context budget enforcement** — Strict limits in compilation prompt (≤6 MCP servers, ≤100 lines CLAUDE.md, ≤3 skills, ≤3 agents) with post-compilation validation warnings
- **`kairn optimize --diff`** — Preview what would change before writing, with colored diff output and apply prompt
- **`kairn doctor`** — Validate .claude/ environments against best practices with weighted scoring (10 checks, pass/warn/fail)

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Structured CLAUDE.md template** — Mandatory 7-section format (Purpose, Tech Stack, Commands, Architecture, Conventions, Key Commands, Output) enforced by compilation prompt
- **Shell-integrated commands** — Generated slash commands use `!` prefix for live shell output (git status, test results, build output)
- **Path-scoped rules** — YAML frontmatter `paths:` support for domain-specific rules (api.md, testing.md, frontend.md)
- **Hooks in settings.json** — Auto-generated PreToolUse hook to block destructive commands; PostToolUse formatter hook for projects with Prettier/ESLint/Black
- **`/project:status` command** — Live git status, recent commits, and TODO overview using `!` prefix
- **`/project:fix` command** — Issue-driven development with `$ARGUMENTS` for issue numbers

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-31

### Added
- **`kairn optimize`** — Scan existing codebases and generate or optimize Claude Code environments

  - Harness auditor checks: CLAUDE.md length, missing commands, missing rules, MCP server count
  - `--audit-only` flag to inspect without generating changes
  - `--yes` flag to skip confirmation prompts
- Backward-compatible config migration — old configs (v1.0.0 format with `anthropic_api_key`) auto-migrate to new format without requiring `kairn init`

### Fixed
- Anthropic model IDs updated to current API names:
  - `claude-sonnet-4-6` (was `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)
