# Kairn Roadmap

> From local CLI to the coordination layer for agent environments.

Each version milestone links to a detailed design doc in `docs/design/` with implementation specifics.

---

## v1.x — Local CLI (Current)

### v1.0.0 ✅
- [x] `kairn init` — multi-provider setup (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google)
- [x] `kairn describe` — intent → environment compilation → .claude/ directory
- [x] `kairn list` — show saved environments
- [x] `kairn activate` — re-deploy saved environments
- [x] `kairn update-registry` — fetch latest tool catalog
- [x] 18 curated tools across search, code, data, communication, design
- [x] Security rules and deny lists by default
- [x] Session continuity patterns (help, tasks, decisions, learnings)

### v1.2.0 ✅
- [x] `kairn optimize` — scan existing codebases, audit and optimize harnesses
- [x] Project scanner (language, framework, deps, scripts, env keys, CI/CD)
- [x] Harness auditor (CLAUDE.md quality, missing commands/rules, MCP bloat)
- [x] Post-setup instructions with API key requirements and signup URLs
- [x] Correct model IDs + backward-compatible config migration

### v1.3.0 — Environment Quality ([design doc](docs/design/v1.3-environment-quality.md))
- [ ] Structured CLAUDE.md template (7-section format enforced by compilation prompt)
- [ ] Shell-integrated commands (`!git diff`, `!npm test` in slash commands)
- [ ] Path-scoped rules with YAML frontmatter (api, testing, frontend)
- [ ] Hooks in settings.json (auto-format, block-destructive, protect-secrets)
- [ ] `/project:status` and `/project:fix` commands
- [ ] Expanded registry (25-30 tools: Sentry, Vercel, Docker, SQLite, Chrome DevTools)
- [ ] Improved TDD skill with subagent isolation pattern

### v1.4.0 — Advanced Patterns ([design doc](docs/design/v1.4-advanced-patterns.md))
- [ ] Sprint contract pattern (`/project:sprint` — define acceptance criteria)
- [ ] Evaluator/tester agent (Playwright-based QA)
- [ ] PostCompact hook for context re-injection
- [ ] Context budget enforcement in compilation prompt
- [ ] `kairn optimize --diff` — preview changes before writing
- [ ] `kairn doctor` — validate environments against Claude Code spec

### v1.5.0 — Templates & Registry
- [ ] Template gallery — pre-built environments (Next.js, API, Research, Content)
- [ ] `kairn templates` — browse and activate templates
- [ ] Registry management (`kairn registry list`, `kairn registry add`)
- [ ] Community tool submissions
- [ ] Hermes runtime adapter

---

## v2.x — Hosted Compilation

- [ ] Free hosted compilation endpoint — no local LLM key needed
- [ ] Web dashboard for environment management
- [ ] Template marketplace — share and discover environments
- [ ] Detect and adapt to existing user MCP servers

---

## v3.x — Integrated Payments

- [ ] Zero-friction tool provisioning via Stripe MPP
- [ ] Usage tracking and spending controls
- [ ] BYOK (bring your own key) flow for non-MPP tools

---

## v4.x — Learning System

- [ ] Automated tool discovery (GitHub, npm, community)
- [ ] Usage-based quality scoring
- [ ] Workflow-to-environment recommendation model

---

## Principles

1. **Minimal over complete.** Fewer, well-chosen tools beat many generic ones.
2. **Workflow-specific over generic.** Every generated file relates to the actual task.
3. **Local-first.** Everything works offline. Hosted features are optional.
4. **Transparent.** Users can inspect every generated file.
5. **Security by default.** Every environment includes deny rules and security guidance.
